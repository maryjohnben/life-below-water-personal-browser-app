# life-below-water-personal-browser-app

Recently I got the opportunity to participate in JP Morgan Chase Hack for Social Good Hackathon. The assigned task for our group of six was to build a full stack application that let users to login into their personal account in order to perform various tasks such as to sign up for volunteer opportunites to help with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal - Life Below Water.

The app consists of various features such as: 
- user login
- user signup
- search for volunteer opportunities
- Locations available near the user to help with the Susttainable Development goal
- signup for volunteer tasks
- track progress
- home page
- profile page

The current app in the development process is going to be browser based and will utilizeb the following technologies and will be developed using Test Driven Development:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- NodeJS
- CSS
- HTML
- Material UI
- React Router
- React Hooks
- React Bootstrap

Mobile Application using React Native will be coming soon following the current browser based project.
