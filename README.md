# life-below-water-personal-browser-app

Recently I got the opportunity to participate in JP Morgan Chase bank's Hack for Social Good Hackathon. The assigned task was to build a full stack application that let's users login to their personal account to sign up for volunteer opportunites tgo help with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal - Life Below Water.

The app will consist of various features such as: 
- user login
- user signup
- search for volunteer opportunities
- signup for volunteer tasks
- track progress
