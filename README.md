# life-below-water-personal-browser-app

Recently I got the opportunity to participate in JP Morgan Chase bank's Hack for Social Good Hackathon. The assigned task was to build a full stack application that let's users login to their personal account to sign up for volunteer opportunites to help with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal - Life Below Water.

The app consist of various features such as: 
- user login
- user signup
- search for volunteer opportunities
- Locations available near the user to help with the Goal
- signup for volunteer tasks
- track progress
- home page
- profile page

The current app in the development process is going to be browser based and will utilize following technologies:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- NodeJS
- CSS
- HTML
- Material UI
- React Router
- React Hooks
- React Bootstrap
- MongoDB

Mobile Application using React Native will be coming soon following the current browser based project.
*Technologies to be used is subject to change based on the need of the project.
